**Idea-01:**
### Universal Gamer Watch Index

#### Problem and service:
A universal gamer index is a design pointed at keeping tract of gamers from different platforms, more specifically gamers who are troubled/being “toxic.” The internet is a 
common environment of anonymity and therefore many individuals feel that they have reason to act however they wish no matter how rude or offensive seeming that there is little 
consequence for their actions. 

#### Importance:
To maintain a healthy society, one must not only look upon public offenders but also those who take it to the web. Many individuals who may appear to be common or genuine on the 
outside may contain a dark personal in which they use on the internet. People such the naively innocent, particularly when it comes to younger electronic users could easily be 
swayed by the opinions around them. This could lead to cyberbullying, or the allowing individuals to be indulged into potential hate-groups should there be one involved. 

#### Concept and Distribution:
The idea is to have a site which monitors those who are on an “offense”-list.  To get one on the list, once an individual has committed enough “toxic”-acts, or if they opt for a 
more offensive act (direct obvious cyberbullying or attempts of or recruiting into a “hate-crime.”). One would have to submit an evidence piece to the website, and upon extensive 
investigation would determine if the individual is qualified to be tracked on the website. If approved, they will be notified the console service (Xbox, PS4, Switch, etc.) or the 
game distribution service (Steam, Origin, UPlay, etc.) if on PC, where they would use a tracking filter to keep tabs on what the users says to others (More specifically a 
text-filter.) Anything continuous offenses will be record on the website. However, through a period, if the user stops committing bad-acts they could potentially be discharged 
from being monitored, however the website would keep them on record, but with a noticed that they are no longer being tracked.  

The website will feature separate colors theme depending on the medium/console they choose, a universal theme would also be provided should the interacting-user choose to. 
There website currently would likely have three categories (tabs). One featuring a direct database which container all the users on the blacklist, upon clicking on them would 
prompt their on-site profile with various details such as how many bad-acts they committed what was the act that got them onto the page, and if they are still being monitored. 
The second category would be a specific filter, dedicated to specific acts which would then each different show a smaller database containing a list of offenders who commit
said-act; taking the interacting-user to an evidence page, which could also lead directly to the user’s blacklist profile page. The last category would be dedicated for 
submissions for potential offenses. This website could also have a mobile-friendly version.

**Idea-02:**
### AR Plant Status App:

#### Problem: 
Maintaining the health of household plants is a difficult task for many hobbyist plant owners. The species and sub-species of household plants are many, and care instructions and ailments vary accordingly. There exist online encyclopaedia-like websites with plant care instructions, apps that can determine the species of plant using an image, and – more recently – an app that can tell you what ails your plant based on a picture of your plant. There are also a few apps that help with tracking the watering schedule for your plants, although the schedule has to be set manually, and apps that determine the level of sunlight your plants are getting based on their location in your house relative to the sun’s current position in the sky. With such a vast array of apps available, the average plant hobbyist might find themselves lost between several apps for tracking the health of their plants. Moreover, each app includes many features, which would require the user to become familiar with the layout of the UI, even if they only need one of the app’s features. This is why we need one app that will manage all aspects of plant health in a user-friendly way.  
  
#### Importance: 
The experience of needing to jump between several apps just to manage one aspect of your life is not good. This applies to the current state of plant management apps. Such an experience would be especially frustrating for users who are new to plant care and plant care apps, or to senior or cognitively impaired users. The situation is exacerbated by the supposition that the people most in need of plant care management apps would be inexperienced plant carers and people with executive functioning issues. We need one app that will allow management of all aspects of plant care – watering, fertilizing, sunlight, soil issues, and diseases – which is catered to the specific type of plant the user cares for. This app should be accessible to children, people with executive functioning issues, and senior people. Note that a mobile app solution is desirable because of its portability and on-the-go photography and video solutions. Many people also use mobile apps to keep track of their to-dos and events because of the portable notification / reminder functionality, which helps with executive function.  


#### Concept and Distribution: 
Our proposed solution to the above problem is to design a mobile app featuring an AR status screen for each plant the phone camera sees. The status screen would offer a colour-based representation of the health of the plant, as well as the nickname and species of the plant. The status screen would be expandable upon being clicked to show more detailed information about the status of each aspect of plant health, like soil water saturation, amount of sunlight in a day, soil nutrient levels (fertilizer), and any diseases. The app would compute the status by extracting an image of the plant from the camera view, and performing a deep learning algorithm on the image to compare it with existing images of the same plant at varying health levels. Sunlight would be tracked based on the location of the phone compared to the supposed location of the sun based on the time of day. Water and fertilizer levels would need to be tracked based on user input as the visibility of soil in a plant pot is not guaranteed. It would be possible to automatically detect water levels based on the view of the soil in the case where soil is visible. Another option is to ask the user to select from a list of images of soil, which image their soil matches best. Once it is time to water or fertilize a plant, the app will send a reminder to the user (based on user preferences). As for the education part of plant care apps, our mobile app would feature a library of articles on the basics of plant care. It may point the user to a certain article from the plant status screen if it shows a particular issue. The library would also be searchable and the content would be grouped into hierarchies of information. The app would be distributed on app stores for Google and Apple and require permission to use the camera.

**Idea-03:**
### Universal Automotive App:

#### Problem
Controlling your car can be a pain to do manually especially constantly having to check gas and oil levels and having to kick your tires to see which one lacks pressure. 
This can take time out of people already busy days and left ignored could cause problems. 

#### Importance
The idea is to offer a convenient way for users to check all these features from their phone as well as control most of the cars features from their phone, acting as a universal remote in a sense.
This feature would be available to all cars as opposed to current implementations that only consider Tesla cars. 

Trying to make a phone app that works as a remote control for your vehicle 
It will allow you to control various features of your car from your phone
* Heating
* Radio
* Check gas
* Check trie pressure
* Check oil levels
* Control seat position 
* Move side mirrors
* Check rearview camera
* GPS so you don’t lose your car in a parking lot

Implementing these features would allow users to conveniently access the cars most important features from their phone is a quick and efficient manner

The design would implement a user unique login where the user would have to link cars to their license through their local AMA (or equivalent motto insurance company)
Logging in would require trusted devices as well as 2 factor authentication to lessen risk of fraud.  Users would hen be able to save their personal vehicles toothier account.
From there users would have options to which feature they would like to access broken into categories
* Levels - to check gas, oil, etc
* Setting - to change seat location, mirror positions heating/radio etc
* Find my car - to help find your car in a parking lot ‘
* Turn on car - for cold winter days when you want car to heat up before 
    * This can be done on alarm (turn on at 8am on this day)


Additionaly most options will be inaccessible while car is being driven as well as per users request and can only be unlocked by unique 1time user set ID. 

#### Problem and service: 
There are no universal remote control applications that can provide viable information to the user about their vehicle. This application aims to make it convenient for users to operate functions on their vehicles remotely. 
The difficulty and cost of diagnosing your vehicle are not convenient to the user and it is also time-consuming (i.e taking it to the mechanic). The application would provide information to the user so they can maintain their vehicle easily prevent any future issues.
