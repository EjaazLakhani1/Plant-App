#Project Description

Our mobile application called “Photo-synthesis”, is an AR application which would engage younger demographics with a fun and creative way to learn about plants. Cartoon-figures will assist the user with finding the best location to place their plants or, users can opt to scan-in a pre-determined one. Either way, cartoon-figures will provide step-by-step assistance, helpful tips and positive feedback when the user accomplishes a task, constructive feedback will be provided if something goes wrong to help the user learn. The app would have several features implemented that usually require accessing a web-browser, this would include research, explanations, product shopping, and so on. The application would be intended for children however would be an option to disable the cartoon filters for a baseline version (in terms of cartoon assistance, graphics, etc.).

Our app doesn’t target a particular type of user, the design is most suitable for the plant enthusiast with any level experience. Beginners, specifically with little to no experience and others interested in owning, caring for, and growing their own plants. The users are categorized as: students, novice gardeners, or household plant owners. 
In typical households, family members can use the app to understand the responsibilities of owning plants. The parents of younger family members can be both stakeholders and users. As a stakeholder, they would want their child to use the app as a learning tool, for instance learning the responsibility of ownership. This app would make teaching children about plants easier, manageable and convenient for their parents. As users, the kids and their parents are expected to have minimal experience, they could learn together through the app.
In a school setting, our app can be used by students to learn about and study the nature of plants. In this case, the schools and teachers who integrate this app into their courses will be the stakeholders. The app would encourage students to learn, positively impacting their attitude towards the environment. Instructors are expected to have background knowledge to provide supporting information and deeper explanations. Students would have limited knowledge, but learn quickly via the use of our application.   
Advanced users can utilize this app to assist with their daily activities, impacting their productivity in a meaningful way.
Gardeners can use the information presented on our app to achieve optimal growth of their garden. Plantsmen can use the built-in encyclopedia to discover fascinating plants as candidates for their collection.
Botanists can use the app to aid in their research as it would make certain processes faster.

#IDEO Methods:
1. Survery and Question

When building an application involving user interaction, one of the best ways to start research is to get user data through surveys and questionnaires. Our team designed a Google Docs user survey, which covered topics like daily life, plant-caring, and experience with mobile and AR technologies. We focused on building a technology that is catered towards people of a younger demographic yet appealing enough such that people of older demographics won’t be turned off by its look-and-feel being traditionally child-centered or cartoon-like. With that being said, we recommended all individuals taking the survey to attempt stepping into the shoes of a 10-year-old child, precisely when they were being asked about app- and plant-related questions. When we analyzed our results, we focused on two main categories - people 24 and under (younger youth) compared to people above 24 (older youth), to people past 50 for the more 'experienced' or 'mature' set of users. 

Overall, almost everyone who took the survey acknowledged that they own plants or have taken care of plants before. Analyzing answers from the younger to older youth demographics on questions about mobile games and amount of time spent on various activities in life, we were not surprised to find a gradual increase in “busyness” with age. Youth had significantly more time for their hobbies whereas older youth and individuals from the 'mature' set were shown to have little time for leisure (including time spent on mobile devices). One surprising factor was that, when asked their favourite mobile game, many people in the early-youth group selected ‘Pokémon Go’ as their choice, whereas individuals in the older youth group went for games like “Minecraft” or “Among Us.” In the most mature demographic, more mundane games like “Candy Crush” started to appear. It seems that late youth face increased gaming expectations, sicne most (despite being busier than the younger youth) would choose to play a game that requires investing a consecutive chunk of time into it. For example, whereas a game like Candy Crush or Pokémon Go are on-the-run games, a game like Minecraft would have sessions that could go for 30 minutes up to a few hours.

Another good thing to notice was the separation between wanting straightforward explanation/instructions amongst the younger crowd and the shift towards straight-forward/both to a full detailed-oriented description amongst the mature group. Comparatively, almost everyone liked the idea of graphical assistance and the concept of product recommendations. 

When talking about plants, most people found themselves in the “alright-to-tough” range in terms of fully managing a plant. No one  seemed to have trouble with the task of watering itself; however, especially amongst the younger crowd, there was frustration on when to water and how much at a time. Other issues in both youth and meture groups included fertilizing and other various planting caring techniques, however it would appear that younger people found it harder to “learn how to take care of a plan” versus “remembering how to take care of a plant.” This, in turn, matched up well with the youth wanting a step-by-step guide feature compared to the more in-depth “why is my plant dying” feature that the mature group wanted. 

2. Shadowing

Using the “Look” method of shadowing, we decided to follow one of our family members throughout their daily routine along with analyzing those specific moments they had; attending to their plants. From this information, we were able to find some common issues with regards to plant caring. For most, it seemed like a love-hate relationship. The wanting to nourish and take good care of the plant, however feeling as though it’s a chore to do so. ‘How much water does it need? Did I remember to water it at all?’ 

Other occurrences ranging from: leaves falling, color change, or unprecedented dehydration. All of these issues result in spending more time on the internet searching for a solution. It’s time consuming whereas they could be doing something else. 


3. Error Analysis 

It’s important to take note of all the potential ways a design would go south. When we were conducting our research, we already anticipated how a few things would go unplanned or may arise as an issue as time went on. Many software related issues could headaches such as; 

-	The plant doesn’t get scanner in properly 
-	The app recommends the wrong product (fertilizer, soil, etc.) 
-	The UI is slow and unoptimized 
-	The production transaction/order fails or doesn’t work properly (Assuming this function is still provided) 

After reflexing from the results from our sent-out survey, and shadowing sessions. We have also been able to determine some potential way in which our design would produce a negative user experience;

-	The app ends up being too “simplistic” or becomes a “cartoonish”-annoyance, making it unappealing to a mature demographic. In reverse, it becomes too serious such that is does not seems intuitive for younger people.
-	The UI is too messy to navigate through and it comes tedious or unappealing. 
-	The product suggestions are unrelatable or non-convincing. 


#Justification of reserach methods 

When selecting our IDEO methods, we first decide that the best course of action was to first extract as much user-information as we could. So, we first decide to run with the Survey and Questionnaire. By doing this we were able determine what were some common annoyances with regards to plant owning along with some studies on their daily routine and opinions on mobile applications. However, we need more user-data and hence we opted for our second IDEO method being shadowing. For those within our group who had family members that took care of plants, we spent a day spectating their routine interactions and noted certain aspects such as frustrations or even potential solutions with regards to how they treat their plants. Lastly, with the data we’ve been able to extract from both previous methods, when combined with some pre-proposed issues, we were able to develop a list of all the potential ways our design would go wrong. 


#Method reflection 

We had little trouble collecting data or proposing ideas when conducting the three methods. We see that the combination works relatively well; which is a mix between two data collections and one list of potential flaws. This set makes for a very good foundation on how we are going to ensure our design is of high expectations. However, one thing that I realized wasn’t really as “well.” While not “poor,” I found that some of the questions we were asking in the survey may not have been all that necessary nor valuable in terms of collecting data and instead just ended up crowding the screen. 

#Users tasks 

1.  User would be able to use application scanner

- By using the scanner, they would be able to detect what the plant is, what its current condition 	 is; it’s hydration level, what type of soil it’s using, or what types of problems are arise from the plant. 

2. User can be properly guided into setting up a healthy plant environment and successfully raising said plant through good instructions and reminders.

- Step by step and easy-to-understand instructions would be provided throughout all steps of setup and maintenance of the plant, additional complex explanations and justifications for actions would be offered, if wanted. 

3. Users would have access to additional information beyond the plant that they scan. 

- If users are looking for a plant-index or more information on plant species, soil, or tools. The user-interface would also contain a wiki-like glossary which provide an alternative for those who need to re-open a computer or hope into an internet browser to start looking for answer. 

4. Users who are using the gamified features would have a fun and intuitive experience. 

- People who using the cartoony graphical-gamified version would experience something similar to the lines of ‘Tamagotchi’ or ‘Cooking Mama’ making it a fun and enjoyable time all the while learning valuable lessons on how to take good care of plants.   

5. The application would also be able to provide ‘good answers’ as solutions to problems that they scan. 

- Not only the application scanner-and-determine problems, but also when finding a problem, they will also determine the best course of action to solve the problem or a potential production recommendation. 

6. User would be able to buy products that they were recommended.

- When the user is given the option to buy a product, they will be offered a easy, quick and clean microtransaction system, which would contain common online payment methods, debit, visa, PayPal, Alipay, etc.
