# CPSC481_Project_TeamI_StageTwo_Branch

## Description: 
Group project for HCI.

`stage_two` branch is dedicated to showing the process of stage two of the project. More contents to come. 


## Contribution guidelines:
_Note: These are about git bash because that's what I'm comfortable with at this point._

1. Push your commits to the branch associated with the current stage (ex: `stage_one`)

2. Commit your changes locally (so that you can do step 3)

    a. Use descriptive commit messages

    b. You can edit and preview Markdown (.md) files in Visual Studio Code. See: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview

    c. If you need to add something small to your previous commit, you can use `git commit --amend` to edit the previous commit

3. Do a `git pull --rebase` before pushing your local commits to remote
    
    a. This should ensure we don't get conflicts

4. Do NOT do `git push --force`

    a. This will mess up other people's local commit histories.

5. We leave the stage branches as-is after we're done with the stage. New stage branches should be created based off of `master`.
